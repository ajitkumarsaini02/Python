```\n","\n","* **Explicit Conversion (Type Casting):**\n","  You manually convert one data type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n","  Example:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  x = \"10\"\n","  y = int(x)  # y is now an integer\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 💬 **Comments in Python**\n","\n","* **Single-line comment:**\n","  Use `#` to write single-line comments.\n","  Example:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  # This is a single-line comment\n","  ```\n","\n","* **Multi-line comment:**\n","  Use triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) for multi-line comments
